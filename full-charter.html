<h1>ORPHANED CHARTER</h1>
<p class="center"><em>Declaration of Principles for a New Beginning</em></p>

<div class="divider">—</div>

<h3>PREAMBLE</h3>
<p>
We begin again.<br>
Not from perfection, but from memory, vision, and necessity.
</p>
<p>
We, the people—scarred, aware, and resolute—establish this Constitution to anchor our shared future in justice, dignity, and balance. We pledge to protect what must endure, to adapt what must evolve, and to guard against every silence that once enabled collapse.
</p>

<h2>ARTICLE I – THE FOUNDATION</h2>
<ol>
  <li>This society is a democratic, secular, and ecological republic.</li>
  <li>All power begins and ends with the people.</li>
  <li>The dignity of the individual is inviolable. The health of the planet is non-negotiable.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE II – RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE REVOKED</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Every person has the right to live free from fear, domination, and neglect.</li>
  <li>Core freedoms—of thought, expression, movement, belief, and identity—are unassailable.</li>
  <li>Each person has the right to participate in public life: to vote, to serve, and to dissent. These rights shall be universal and equal.</li>
  <li>Privacy, bodily autonomy, and informed consent are not privileges. They are guarantees.</li>
  <li>Non-derogable rights include, at minimum: the right to life, freedom from torture, slavery, and retroactive punishment. Further derogation shall be permitted only in accordance with law, necessity, and proportionality.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE III – WHAT WE OWE EACH OTHER</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Healthcare is a human right, not a commodity.</li>
  <li>Education is a lifelong public good.</li>
  <li>Work must be fair, safe, and valued.</li>
  <li>Housing, food, clean water, and digital access form the floor beneath which no one shall fall.</li>
  <li>These rights shall be progressively realized through legislation, subject to judicial review for reasonableness and non-discrimination.</li>
  <li>Indigenous rights are living rights: to land, language, culture, and governance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE IV – THE PLANET IS A STAKEHOLDER</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The natural world has standing.</li>
  <li>Every generation has the right to inherit a livable climate.</li>
  <li>Environmental harm is a breach of constitutional order.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE V – GOVERNMENT AS A TOOL</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Governance shall be transparent, accountable, and participatory.</li>
  <li>Legislative power is bicameral, representative, and responsive to citizen proposals.</li>
  <li>Executive power is limited by time, law, and public oversight.</li>
  <li>Judicial power is independent, ethical, and bound to reason.</li>
  <li>Judges may be removed for proven misconduct following independent investigation, due process, and supermajority confirmation by the legislature.</li>
  <li>No emergency cancels the Constitution.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE VI – DEMOCRACY IS NOT A PERFORMANCE</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Voting is a right and a duty, beginning at age 16.</li>
  <li>Elections are publicly funded. Private influence is prohibited.</li>
  <li>Civic technologies must be open, secure, and auditable.</li>
  <li>Citizens shall directly shape budgets and reforms.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE VII – MEMORY IS PROTECTION</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Whistleblowers and journalists are guardians of the public trust.</li>
  <li>No party, faction, or ideology may arm itself against the people.</li>
  <li>The military shall serve—and never rule.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE VIII – GLOBAL INTERDEPENDENCE</h2>
<ol>
  <li>We uphold international law, climate justice, and human rights.</li>
  <li>Refugees shall be treated with dignity, and asylum is a right.</li>
  <li>We practice peace through cooperation, not through conquest.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE IX – THE FUTURE IS WATCHING</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Data, algorithms, and emerging technologies must serve humanity, not replace or exploit it.</li>
  <li>All persons own their genetic, biometric, and neural data as inalienable personal rights, protected from exploitation and misuse.</li>
  <li>Technological power requires human oversight—ethical, democratic, and adaptive.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE X – THE WHOLE PERSON</h2>
<ol>
  <li>All identities, languages, cultures, and families are equal under law.</li>
  <li>No belief shall be favored; all beliefs shall be respected.</li>
  <li>Each person may live without being asked to justify their existence.</li>
</ol>

<h2>ARTICLE XI – LIVING STRUCTURE</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Amendments altering foundational rights or the structure of government shall require a two-thirds legislative majority and a national referendum.</li>
  <li>Amendments concerning procedural, technological, or administrative matters may be passed with a three-fifths legislative majority and a public notice period, subject to judicial review.</li>
</ol>

<h2>CLOSING STATEMENT</h2>
<p>
This is not a script. It is a compass.<br>
It will not make us perfect.<br>
But it can keep us honest.
</p>
<p>
This Constitution is a living promise—to ourselves, to each other, and to those not yet born.
We will not worship it. We will wield it.
And when the time comes, we will remake it again.
</p>
